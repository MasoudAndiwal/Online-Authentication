# Mark Attendance Page - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Mark Attendance page is a focused, class-based attendance tracking interface for the University Attendance System. This feature allows Office administrators and Teachers to mark student attendance for specific classes with an intuitive, modern UI that matches the existing design system. The page follows the established design patterns from the All Classes, Students, and Teachers pages, using the orange/amber color scheme for consistency.

## Glossary

- **Class**: A group of students enrolled together (e.g., "Class A", "Class B")
- **Session**: Time period for classes - either MORNING or AFTERNOON
- **Attendance Status**: Student's presence state - Present, Absent, Sick, or Leave
- **Mark Attendance**: The action of recording student attendance for a specific date and class

## Design Patterns to Follow

### Color Scheme (from All Classes page)
- Primary: Orange-600 (#EA580C) to Amber-600 (#D97706) gradients
- Statistics Cards: Orange, Amber, Indigo, Green gradients
- Status Colors: Green (Present), Red (Absent), Amber (Sick), Cyan (Leave), Slate (Not Marked)

### Component Patterns
- Use `ModernDashboardLayout` for page wrapper
- Use `Card` and `CardContent` from shadcn/ui
- Use `Button` with gradient backgrounds and hover effects
- Use `Input` with icon prefixes for search
- Use `CustomSelect` for dropdowns
- Use `Badge` for status indicators
- Use Lucide React icons throughout

### Animation Patterns
- Fade-in on mount: `animate-in fade-in duration-500`
- Slide-in with stagger: `animate-in slide-in-from-bottom-4 duration-500` with `animationDelay`
- Hover scale: `hover:scale-102 transition-all duration-200`
- Loading: Skeleton screens with shimmer effect
- Toast notifications: Sonner with slide-in animations

### Layout Patterns
- Responsive grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`
- Statistics cards: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6`
- Card styling: `rounded-2xl shadow-lg border-slate-200`
- Spacing: Consistent padding (p-6) and margins (mb-6, mb-8)
