# Mark Attendance Page - Implementation Tasks

## Overview

This implementation plan focuses on creating a beautiful, frontend-only Mark Attendance page that matches the design patterns from the All Classes, Students, and Teachers pages. The page will use the orange/amber color scheme and store attendance data in React state (no backend integration yet).

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Patterns to Follow

1. **Color Scheme**: Use orange-600 to amber-600 gradients for primary elements
2. **Card Design**: `rounded-2xl shadow-lg border-slate-200` with gradient backgrounds
3. **Buttons**: Gradient backgrounds with hover effects and shadow elevation
4. **Icons**: Lucide React icons with consistent sizing (h-5 w-5 for buttons, h-6 w-6 for cards)
5. **Typography**: Bold headings, semibold labels, regular body text
6. **Spacing**: Consistent padding (p-6) and gaps (gap-4, gap-6)
7. **Animations**: 300ms transitions, staggered delays for lists, smooth hover effects

### Component Reuse

- Use existing components: `ModernDashboardLayout`, `PageContainer`, `Card`, `Button`, `Input`, `Badge`, `CustomSelect`
- Follow patterns from `all-classes/page.tsx` for layout and styling
- Match statistics card design from `students/page.tsx` and `teachers/page.tsx`

### State Management Strategy

- Use React useState for local state
- Use Map for attendance records (efficient lookups)
- Use useMemo for filtered/computed data
- Use useCallback for event handlers to prevent re-renders

### Future Backend Integration

- All data fetching uses existing API endpoints (`/api/classes`, `/api/students`)
- Attendance state is stored in React state (ready for POST to `/api/attendance` later)
- No backend changes needed for this phase
- Backend integration will be a separate task after frontend is complete
