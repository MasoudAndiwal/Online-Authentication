# Design Document

## Overview

The University Attendance System is a modern, visually stunning, high-trust web application built with Next.js 15, React 19, and PostgreSQL. The system implements a sophisticated role-based architecture supporting Office administrators, Teachers, and Students with comprehensive dashboard functionality featuring cutting-edge UI/UX design with modern component libraries, beautiful animations, and 3D iconography. The application follows a weekly attendance tracking model (Saturday-Thursday) with advanced academic rule enforcement for disqualification and certification requirements, featuring extensive reporting and analytics capabilities with immersive animations and interactions.

### Core Design Principles
- **Visual Excellence**: Modern glassmorphism design with vibrant gradients, 3D icons from Lucide React and Heroicons, smooth micro-interactions, and contemporary aesthetics
- **Modern Interactions**: Framer Motion animations with spring physics, hover effects with 3D transforms, gesture-based interactions, and delightful micro-animations
- **Comprehensive Navigation**: Floating navigation with blur effects, animated sidebar with 3D depth, smooth page transitions, and gesture-based menu systems
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Office sees system control with animated metric cards and 3D charts, Teachers see class management with interactive progress rings, Students see personal overview with gamified elements
- **Business Rule Implementation**: Sophisticated logic for disqualification (pure absence tracking) and certification workflow with animated status indicators and progress visualization
- **Advanced Reporting**: Interactive dashboards with animated charts, student status tracking with 3D badges, and multi-format export with progress animations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-optimized interactions, gesture navigation, and adaptive 3D layouts
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and reduced motion preferences
- **Performance**: Optimized for large user bases with skeleton loading states, lazy loading, and smooth 60fps animations

### Modern Animation Patterns & 3D Effects

#### Micro-Interactions
```typescript
// Button hover with 3D effect
const buttonVariants = {
  idle: { 
    scale: 1, 
    rotateX: 0, 
    rotateY: 0,
    boxShadow: "0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"
  },
  hover: { 
    scale: 1.05, 
    rotateX: -5, 
    rotateY: 5,
    boxShadow: "0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)",

    rotateX: 0,
    rotateY: 0,
    boxShadow: "0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"
  }
};

// Status badge pulse animation
const statusPulse = {
  scale: [1, 1.1, 1],
  opacity: [1, 0.8, 1],
  transition: {
    duration: 2,
    repeat: Infinity,
    ease: "easeInOut"
  }
};
```

#### Page Transitions
```typescript
// Smooth page transitions with parallax
const pageVariants = {
  initial: { 
    opacity: 0, 
    x: -100, 
    scale: 0.95,
    filter: "blur(10px)"
  },
  in: { 
    opacity: 1, 
    x: 0, 
    scale: 1,
    filter: "blur(0px)",
    transition: { 
      duration: 0.4, 
      ease: "easeOut" 
    }
  },
  out: { 
    opacity: 0, 
    x: 100, 
    scale: 1.05,
    filter: "blur(5px)",
    transition: { 
      duration: 0.3, 
      ease: "easeIn" 
    }
  }
};
```

#### 3D Card Effects
```typescript
// Glass morphism card with 3D hover
const cardVariants = {
  rest: {
    rotateX: 0,
    rotateY: 0,
    scale: 1,
    background: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)",
    backdropFilter: "blur(20px)",
    boxShadow: "0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"
  },
  hover: {
    rotateX: -10,
    rotateY: 10,
    scale: 1.02,
    background: "rgba(255,255,255,0.9)",
    backdropFilter: "blur(25px)",
    boxShadow: "0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)",
    transition: {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 300,
      damping: 20
    }
  }
};
```

#### Data Loading Animations
```typescript
// Skeleton loading with shimmer effect
const shimmerVariants = {
  initial: { x: "-100%" },
  animate: { 
    x: "100%",
    transition: {
      repeat: Infinity,
      duration: 1.5,
      ease: "linear"
    }
  }
};

// Count-up animation for metrics
const countUpVariants = {
  initial: { scale: 0.8, opacity: 0 },
  animate: { 
    scale: 1, 
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { 
      type: "spring", 
      stiffness: 200, 
      damping: 15 
    }
  }
};
```

#### Interactive Chart Animations
```typescript
// Chart data point hover effects
const chartPointVariants = {
  rest: { 
    scale: 1, 
    fill: "#3B82F6" 
  },
  hover: { 
    scale: 1.5, 
    fill: "#1D4ED8",
    transition: { 
      type: "spring", 
      stiffness: 400, 
      damping: 10 
    }
  }
};

// Bar chart growth animation
const barGrowth = {
  initial: { scaleY: 0, originY: 1 },
  animate: { 
    scaleY: 1,
    transition: { 
      duration: 0.8, 
      ease: "easeOut",
      delay: (index: number) => index * 0.1
    }
  }
};
```

#### Notification System
```typescript
// Toast notification slide-in
const toastVariants = {
  initial: { 
    x: 300, 
    opacity: 0, 
    scale: 0.8 
  },
  animate: { 
    x: 0, 
    opacity: 1, 
    scale: 1,
    transition: { 
      type: "spring", 
      stiffness: 300, 
      damping: 25 
    }
  },
  exit: { 
    x: 300, 
    opacity: 0, 
    scale: 0.8,
    transition: { 
      duration: 0.2 
    }
  }
};
```

### Modern Responsive Design & Accessibility

#### Responsive Breakpoints
```typescript
const breakpoints = {
  xs: '320px',   // Mobile portrait
  sm: '640px',   // Mobile landscape
  md: '768px',   // Tablet portrait
  lg: '1024px',  // Tablet landscape / Small desktop
  xl: '1280px',  // Desktop
  '2xl': '1536px' // Large desktop
};
```

- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Focus management with visible indicators
  - Skip links for main content
  - Logical tab order
  - Keyboard shortcuts for power users
  - Escape key handling for modals

- **Screen Reader Support**:

```typescript
const darkModeColors = {
  background: {
    primary: '#0F172A',
    secondary: '#1E293B',
    tertiary: '#334155'
  },
  text: {
    primary: '#F8FAFC',
    secondary: '#CBD5E1',
    muted: '#64748B'
  },
  accent: {
    blue: '#3B82F6',
    purple: '#8B5CF6',
    green: '#10B981'
  }
};
```

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Loading Strategies**:
  - Lazy loading for images and components
  - Skeleton screens during data fetching
  - Progressive image loading with blur-up
  - Code splitting by routes and features
  - Service worker for offline functionality

- **Animation Performance**:
  - Hardware acceleration with transform3d
  - RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
  - Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
  - Reduced motion preferences respect
  - 60fps target for all animations

## Architecture

### System Architecture Pattern
The application follows a **layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Presentation Layer - Next.js Pages/Components] --> B[Business Logic Layer - Services/Hooks]
    B --> C[Data Access Layer - Prisma/Repositories]
    C --> D[Database Layer - PostgreSQL]
    
    E[Authentication Middleware] --> A
    F[Authorization Guards] --> B
    G[Validation Layer - Zod Schemas] --> B
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Administrator**: Full system access, account management, configuration, reporting
- **Teacher**: Class-specific attendance management, student viewing
- **Student**: Read-only access to personal attendance data

### Security Architecture
- JWT-based authentication with secure session management
- Role-based middleware for API route protection
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- CSRF protection and secure headers
