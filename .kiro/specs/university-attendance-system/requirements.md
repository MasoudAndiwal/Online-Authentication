# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The University Attendance System is a modern web application designed to digitize and streamline the attendance tracking process for universities. The system serves three distinct user roles: Office staff (administrators), Teachers, and Students. Office staff manage schedules and generate reports, teachers mark attendance for their assigned classes, and students view their attendance records. The system replaces traditional paper-based attendance sheets with a secure, mobile-friendly digital solution that maintains audit trails and provides comprehensive reporting capabilities.
