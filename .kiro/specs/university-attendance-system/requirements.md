# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The University Attendance System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to manage student attendance tracking for a university environment. The system features a modern, high-trust, user-friendly dashboard that matches the beautiful design aesthetics of the existing login page with university blue palette, smooth animations, micro-interactions, and professional campus look. The dashboard must feel as polished and "college portal" worthy as the login page, implementing sophisticated business rules for attendance management. The system operates on a weekly schedule (Saturday to Thursday) with role-based access control where Office administrators manage accounts and system configuration, Teachers mark attendance for their assigned classes, and Students view their personal attendance records. The system enforces strict academic rules regarding disqualification (محروم) and certification requirements (تصدیق طلب) based on attendance patterns, with comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities.
