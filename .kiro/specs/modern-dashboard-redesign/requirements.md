# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on redesigning the university attendance system dashboard page to match the modern, beautiful UI/UX design of the login page. The current dashboard has a simple, outdated appearance reminiscent of early 2000s websites, while the login page features sophisticated animations, gradients, modern icons, and beautiful visual effects. The goal is to transform the dashboard into a visually stunning, modern interface that provides an excellent user experience with smooth animations and contemporary design elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components load THEN the system SHALL animate them in with staggered timing using Framer Motion
2. WHEN users hover over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide scale and color transition effects
3. WHEN data updates THEN the system SHALL animate the changes smoothly
4. WHEN cards appear THEN the system SHALL use entrance animations with spring physics
5. WHEN users interact with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide tactile feedback through animations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an office administrator, I want the dashboard layout to use modern spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy, so that information is easy to scan and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL implement a clear typographic hierarchy with appropriate font weights
3. WHEN showing content sections THEN the system SHALL use proper visual grouping and white space
4. WHEN displaying cards THEN the system SHALL implement consistent border radius and shadow effects
5. WHEN users view the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design across all screen sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an office administrator, I want the dashboard to have the same sophisticated background effects as the login page, so that the visual experience is consistent throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
