# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive, production-ready backend system for student and teacher management using Prisma ORM with a Supabase PostgreSQL database. The system provides full CRUD operations with advanced features including pagination, filtering, sorting, search, authentication, role-based access control, transactions, and performance optimizations. The implementation includes robust data models, API routes, validation, error handling, and database indexing to support both existing frontend pages and future scalability requirements.

2. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/teachers THEN the system SHALL return paginated results with support for filtering by department/subject/qualification, sorting by any field, and text search across name fields
3. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/teachers/[id] THEN the system SHALL return the specific teacher record (excluding password) or 404 if not found
4. WHEN a PUT request is made to /api/teachers/[id] THEN the system SHALL validate the data, check for conflicts, and update the teacher record using a transaction
5. WHEN any teacher API is called without proper authentication THEN the system SHALL return 401 unauthorized
6. WHEN pagination parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return results with page, limit, total, and hasMore metadata

### Requirement 4: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust authentication and role-based access control, so that only authorized users can access and modify data according to their permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is called THEN it SHALL verify the Supabase JWT token and extract user information
2. WHEN a user's role is checked THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions (office staff can CRUD, teachers can read own data, students can read own data)
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 with clear error messages
4. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return 403 with clear error messages
5. WHEN passwords are stored THEN they SHALL be hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12
6. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN they SHALL integrate with Supabase Auth for consistency

### Requirement 5: Data Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive data validation and clear error handling, so that the system provides helpful feedback and maintains data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API receives data THEN it SHALL validate using Zod schemas with detailed error messages for each field
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return 400 with structured error details including field names and specific validation messages
3. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (409 for conflicts, 500 for server errors)
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged server-side with sufficient detail for debugging while returning sanitized messages to clients
5. WHEN phone numbers are validated THEN they SHALL follow international format standards
6. WHEN array fields are validated THEN they SHALL enforce minimum/maximum lengths and valid enum values where applicable

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to perform well under load and scale efficiently, so that it can handle large numbers of students and teachers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL use proper indexes for filtering, sorting, and searching operations
2. WHEN list endpoints are called THEN they SHALL implement cursor-based pagination for large datasets
3. WHEN search operations are performed THEN they SHALL use database-level full-text search capabilities
4. WHEN multiple database operations are needed THEN they SHALL use Prisma transactions to ensure data consistency
5. WHEN the system handles concurrent requests THEN it SHALL prevent race conditions and maintain data integrity
6. WHEN query performance is measured THEN common operations SHALL complete within acceptable time limits (< 100ms for simple queries)

### Requirement 7: Database Transactions and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database operations to be atomic and maintain referential integrity, so that the system remains in a consistent state even during failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating records that involve multiple tables THEN the system SHALL use Prisma transactions to ensure atomicity
2. WHEN updating records THEN the system SHALL use optimistic locking to prevent concurrent modification conflicts
3. WHEN foreign key relationships exist THEN they SHALL be properly enforced at the database level
4. WHEN cascade operations are needed THEN they SHALL be explicitly defined in the Prisma schema
5. WHEN transaction rollbacks occur THEN the system SHALL log the failure and return appropriate error responses
