# 🔒 6-Hour Per Day Limit - CRITICAL FIX

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🚨 The Problem

**What was happening:**
```
Saturday:
✅ Entry 1: Literature (Naseri Hakimi) - 6 hours (08:30-12:45)
❌ Entry 2: Chemistry (d d) - 1 hour (08:30-09:10) ← SHOULD BE BLOCKED!
```

**Issue:** System allowed creating MORE than 6 hours per day!

---

## ✅ The Fix

### **1. Added Total Hours Validation**

**File:** `components/schedule/add-schedule-entry-dialog.tsx`

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// Check if total hours for this day exceeds 6 hours
if (existingEntries && dayOfWeek) {
  const totalHoursOnDay = existingEntries
    .filter(entry => {
      // Exclude current entry if editing
      if (editEntry && entry.id === editEntry.id) return false;
      return entry.dayOfWeek === dayOfWeek;
    })
    .reduce((sum, entry) => sum + (entry.hours || 0), 0);
  
  const newTotalHours = totalHoursOnDay + calculatedTimeRange.hours;
  
  if (newTotalHours > 6) {
    toast.error("Cannot exceed 6 hours per day", {
      description: `This day already has ${totalHoursOnDay} hours scheduled. Adding ${calculatedTimeRange.hours} hours would exceed the 6-hour limit.`,
    });
    return;
  }
}
```

**What it does:**
- Counts TOTAL hours already scheduled on the day
- Adds the NEW hours being added
- If total > 6 → BLOCKS and shows error ✅

### **2. Added Visual Hour Counter**

**New UI Component:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📊 Day Usage: 6/6 hours used                   │
│                            0 hours remaining    │
│ ⚠️ Adding 1 hours would exceed the 6-hour limit!│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Color Coding:**
- 🟢 **Green:** 0-3 hours used (plenty of space)
- 🟡 **Yellow:** 4-5 hours used (running out)
- 🔴 **Red:** 6 hours used (FULL!)

---

### **3. Enhanced Error Messages**

**File:** `app/(office)/dashboard/(class&schedule)/schedule/page.tsx`

**Error Types Now Caught:**
1. **Hours Limit Exceeded:**
   ```
   ❌ Hours Limit Exceeded
   This day already has 6 hours scheduled. Adding 1 hours would exceed the 6-hour limit.
   ```

2. **Teacher Schedule Conflict:**
   ```
   ❌ Teacher Schedule Conflict
   Teacher already teaching in Class B (MORNING) from 08:30 to 09:10
   ```

3. **Network Error:**
   ```
   ❌ Network Error
   Unable to connect to the server. Please check your internet connection.
   ```

4. **Duplicate Entry:**
   ```
   ❌ Duplicate Entry
   This schedule entry already exists.
   ```

### **Scenario 1: Saturday Already Full (6 hours)**

**Existing:**
```
Saturday - Class A:
  Literature (Naseri Hakimi) - 6 hours (08:30-12:45)

```
Saturday - Class A:
  Math - 2 hours (08:30-10:30)
  Physics - 2 hours (10:45-12:05)
  Total: 4/6 hours
```

**Try to Add:**
```
Chemistry - 3 hours
Total would be: 4 + 3 = 7 hours ❌
```

**Result:**
```
🔴 BLOCKED!

Chemistry - 2 hours
Total would be: 4 + 2 = 6 hours ✅
```

**Result:**
```
✅ ALLOWED!
